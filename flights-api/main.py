api_description = """
The Air Travel API provides read-only access to historical U.S. flight data.

The API is designed for data science, analytics, API development practice, and
agent/tool-calling demonstrations. It allows users to search flight records by
carrier, flight number, and flight date.

## Analytics

Use the health check endpoint to confirm that the API is running before making
other requests.

## Flight Info

Search for flights using optional filters such as carrier, flight number, and
flight date. Use skip and limit parameters to paginate through larger result
sets.

The flight data comes from the U.S. Department of Transportation Bureau of
Transportation Statistics airline on-time performance data.
